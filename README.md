	I built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset. I populated a dropdown menu with all of the sample IDs. I defined the optionChanged() function in my javascript. I created a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in a certain individual. 
	I used sample_values as the values for the bar chart. I used otu_ids as the labels for the bar chart. I used otu_labels as the hovertext for the chart. A bubble chart was created that displays each sample. I used otu_ids for the x values. I used sample_values for the y values. I used sample_values for the marker size. I used otu_ids for the marker colors. I used otu_labels for the text values. 
	Sample metadata was displayed. Each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object was displayed somewhere on the page. My page was deployed to Github Pages. I had to open my index.html file with Live Server by right clicking on my code in order to load my webpage. My webpage generates a dropdown menu for the test subject ID number, the demographic info, the top ten data points for the bar chart, and the bacteria culture per sample. 
	My Github Pages site is built from the main branch.
